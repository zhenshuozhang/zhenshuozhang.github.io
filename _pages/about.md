<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Northeastern University starting from fall 2024, supervised by Prof. [Hongyang (Ryan) Zhang](https://www.hongyangzhang.com/). Previously, I received my M.S. degree at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2024, supervised by Prof. Siliang Tang. I received the B.Eng. degree at CS, Zhejiang University in 2021. 

My current research focuses on training algorithms in machine learning and data attributions.
