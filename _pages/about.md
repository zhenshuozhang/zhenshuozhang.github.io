I am a Ph.D. student in Northeastern University starting from fall 2024, supervised by Prof. Hongyang (Ryan) Zhang. Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree from [CS](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [ZJU](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english) in 2021 and M.S. degree from ZJU in 2024. My current research focuses on algorithms in machine learning.
